# Loan-Prediction
In this project,  machine learning/statistical models are built in Python to predict the interest rate assigned to a loan. 

## Data
Data includes one training dataset with interese rate known, a testing dataset with interest rate unknown, and a txt file for column description. 

## Steps:
### 1. Clean and prepare the data
### 2. EDA
### 3. Feature Engineering
### 2: Build the models: 7 Models are used in this project
### 3. Model Comparison and Analysis
### 4. Model Selection and Hyper-parameter Tuning
### 5. Test the models using the data found within the "Data for Testing" file.
